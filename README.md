# algorithms-and-datastructures
Learning how different data structures work internally and how to apply them, and when to apply which data structure using different assignments.

The assignements consists of practises of:
- Abstract Datatypes, Iterator/Recursion
- Lists, different Searches, Big-O efficiency, simple and advanced sorts, Comparator
- Stack, Queues, Heap, Hashing, Sets, Maps
- Functional interfaces, Lambda expressions, Streams, Collectors, Method chaining
- (Binary) Trees, Graphs, Paths, Minimal Spanning Tree
